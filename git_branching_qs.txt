Part I

1. What git command creates a branch?

	git branch (new branch name)
	OR
	git checkout -b (new branch name)

2. What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?

	Fast forward merges happen only if there are no prior commits on the original branch. Recursive merges happen when commits happen in other branches on the same file.

3. What git command changes to another branch?

	git checkout (target branch)

4. What git command deletes a branch?

	git branch -d (target branch)
	OR
	git branch -D (target branch)

5. How do merge conflicts happen?

	Merge conflicts happen when edits are made in the same part of a document in different branches and Git is not sure which edits to prioritize.
